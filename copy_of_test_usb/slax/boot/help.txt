 If you need to edit boot command line (for advanced users), hit [Tab].
 When finished, press [Enter].


 Keep changes persistent

 Save all filesystem modifications to 'changes' directory and restore
 those changes next time you boot. Only usable while running from a
 writable media such as USB device or hard disk.


 Copy to RAM

 Copies all data to memory during startup so you can eject the boot device.
 Requires enough RAM to store all modules and to run the system.
